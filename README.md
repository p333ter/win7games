For more details on how to install and use the games, check out [this tutorial](https://winaero.com/download-windows-7-games-for-windows-11/).

### Windows 11 Support

The package has been updated to version 3. It now supports Windows 11. The non-working Game Explorer will no longer be installed. The installer now supports HiDPI displays. Finally, the Internet Games set is now optional, since Microsoft has turned off the game servers, making it nearly impossible to play them.

The support for older Windows version, i.e. Windows 8.1/8 and Windows 10, remains intact. You can use this new version of the package on older Windows versions too.

### Silent setup

The package can be installed in unattend mode. Use the /S command argument, where S is capitalized. `Windows7Games_for_Windows_11_10_8.exe /S`.

Games support the complete set of MUI (language packs), so they will run in your native language. The following languages are supported.

> ar-SA, bg-BG, cs-CZ, da-DK, de-DE, el-GR, en-US, es-ES, et-EE, fi-FI, fr-FR, he-IL, hr-HR, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, lt-LT, lv-LV, nb-NO, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ro-RO, ru-RU, sk-SK, sl-SI, sr-Latn-CS, sv-SE, th-TH, tr-TR, uk-UA, zh-CN, zh-TW

Classic Calculator (Old Calculator)
-----------------------------------

Microsoft has removed the classic calculator app starting in Windows 10 and replaced it with a new UWP app that receives updates from the Store. Many people aren't happy with this change. The classic app loaded faster, and was more useful for mouse and keyboard users. Here you can get the classic calculator back in Windows 11 and Windows 10.

![Classic Old Calculator for Windows 11 and Windows 10](images/calc.png) ![Classic Old Calculator on Windows 11](images/calc-11.png)

This package supports Windows 11 and Windows 10 (both Windows 10 32-bit and Windows 10 64-bit).

![Classic Old Calculator installer](images/calcinstaller-11.png)

The Calculator app will be revived completely, e.g. you will be able to launch it as "calc.exe" from the Run dialog or from the taskbar search box or from Cortana. It will have the same interface language as your operating system. If you will decide to revert to the Modern Calculator app, just uninstall the "Old Classic Calculator" app from the Settings -> Apps - > Apps & features.

It comes with almost the full set of MUI files, so it will be in your native language out-of-the-box. The following locale list is supported: ar-sa, bg-bg, cs-cz, da-dk, de-de, el-gr, en-gb, en-us, es-es, es-mx, et-ee, fi-fi, fr-ca, fr-fr, he-il, hr-hr, hu-hu, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, lt-lt, lv-lv, nb-no, nl-nl, pl-pl, pt-br, pt-pt, ro-ro, ru-ru, sk-sk, sl-si, sr-latn-rs, sv-se, th-th, tr-tr, uk-ua, zh-cn, zh-hk, zh-tw.

Classic Sticky Notes
--------------------

Starting in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft replaced the classic desktop Sticky Notes app with a Universal app. For many users, the classic Desktop app is the more preferable option. It works faster, starts faster and has no Cortana integration.

![Classic Sticky Notes](images/sticky-11.png) ![Classic Sticky Notes](images/sticky.png)

Many prefer the good old classic Sticky Notes app because it consumes notably less system resources. It starts immediately and works much faster. The performance difference is especially visible on less powerful hardware like Atom and Celeron CPUs. The notes themselves are also a bit smaller, so users like their compact appearance more.

Here you can get the Classic Sticky Notes app for Windows 11 and Windows 10. This package fully supports Windows 11, as well as both Windows 10 32-bit and Windows 10 64-bit.

![Classic Sticky Notes installer](images/stickyistaller-11.png)

It comes with almost the full set of MUI files, so it will be in your native language out-of-the-box. The following locale list is supported: ar-sa, bg-bg, cs-cz, da-dk, de-de, el-gr, en-gb, en-us, es-es, es-mx, et-ee, fi-fi, fr-ca, fr-fr, he-il, hr-hr, hu-hu, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, lt-lt, lv-lv, nb-no, nl-nl, pl-pl, pt-br, pt-pt, ro-ro, ru-ru, sk-sk, sl-si, sr-latn-rs, sv-se, th-th, tr-tr, uk-ua, zh-cn, zh-hk, zh-tw.

You can uninstall the app any time from Settings - Apps and features.

Classic Task Manager
--------------------

The new "modern" task manager was introduced in Windows 8. Windows 10 comes with the same Task Manager app. Although some of its functions are not bad, like the performance graph, one might not really need them. The old Task Manager is faster, bug-free and provides a more reliable workflow of task management for many users. Here is how you can get it back without replacing any system files or modifying permissions.

The installer inlcude the classic `msconfig.exe` app with the startup tab in the msconfig UI so you will be able to manage your startup apps.

It comes with almost the full set of MUI files, so it will be in your native language out-of-the-box. The following locale list is supported: ar-sa, bg-bg, cs-cz, da-dk, de-de, el-gr, en-gb, en-us, es-es, es-mx, et-ee, fi-fi, fr-ca, fr-fr, he-il, hr-hr, hu-hu, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, lt-lt, lv-lv, nb-no, nl-nl, pl-pl, pt-br, pt-pt, ro-ro, ru-ru, sk-sk, sl-si, sr-latn-rs, sv-se, th-th, tr-tr, uk-ua, zh-cn, zh-hk, zh-tw.

You can uninstall the app any time from Settings - Apps and features.

Classic Msconfig
----------------

Windows 10 and Windows 8 assume that you use Task Manager for managing your startup apps. If you prefer to use the good old msconfig.exe tool for that, you must be aware that this feature is no longer included in Windows 10 and Windows 8. Here you can get classic msconfig.exe back in Windows 10 and Windows 8 that still includes the "Statup" option.

![Classic msconfig installer](images/msconfig1.png) ![Classic msconfig for Windows 10](images/msconfig2.png)

The installer inlcudes the classic `msconfig.exe` app with the startup tab in the msconfig UI so you will be able to manage your startup apps. It handles the "msconfig" command in the Run dialog. Also, it doesn't replace system files, instead it adds a new file, %windir%\\system32\\msconfig1.exe.

You can uninstall the app any time from Settings - Apps and features.
